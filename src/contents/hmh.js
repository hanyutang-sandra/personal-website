        In 2018, as the <b className='font-semibold'>development lead</b> for Team Otter, 
        I spearheaded the creation of our team website to highlight the outstanding work of my colleagues during the development of our final project. 
        The site was crafted using <b className='font-semibold'>ReactJS</b> and <b className='font-semibold'>Redux</b> for state management, 
        with <b className='font-semibold'>React LazyLoad</b> to optimize performance. 
        For dynamic visual effects, we incorporated <b className='font-semibold'>AnimeJS and React Transition Group</b>. 
        The website, deployed on <b className='font-semibold'>GitHub</b>, effectively showcases our team members, 
        the challenges we addressed, and the extensive research process behind our project. 
        
        <br /><br />

        Developed in collaboration with our team's design lead and content writer, the final product is a visually appealing and smoothly operating <b className='font-semibold'>single-page application</b> that dynamically presents our project's journey and achievements.

        <br/><br/>
        Some key capabilities include:
        <br />
        <b className='font-semibold'>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):</b> Enable students to engage actively by speaking directly to the computer and receiving instantaneous feedback, fostering an interactive learning experience.
        <br />
        <b className='font-semibold'>Branching Scenarios: </b> Features multiple branching storylines that adapt to the learner’s choices, offering repeatable value and customizing the learning experience to individual needs.
        <br />
        <b className='font-semibold'>Motivational Tools: </b> Includes badges and progress tracking to motivate learners and promote ongoing engagement with the content.
        <br />

        <br /><br />
        To support these capabilities, we leveraged several technologies, including <b className='font-semibold'>AnnyangJS</b> for Automatic Speech Recognition, <b className='font-semibold'>H5P</b> Interactive Video 
        Modules on top of <b className='font-semibold'>Drupal 7 CMS with PHP</b> along with multiple open source plugins for animations and authentication purposes.
